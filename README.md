# The Useless Web
Take me to another useless website please. The useless web is a single button, which opens new links to an array of strange and odd websites. Its live [here](http://www.theuselessweb.com).

### Contributions
Feel free to open a pull request adding your website or removing something thats down.

Sadly, I'm not really too active on this any more, and feel that the useless web has a great balance of sites already. Over the past couple of years a lot of sites have come and gone, some couldn't handle the server load, and were excluded (since it dilutes the overall experience).

I'm also not including websites that have advertising, or any real ulterior motives outside of being totally useless.
