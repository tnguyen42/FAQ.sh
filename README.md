### Contributions
Feel free to make a pull request if you want to contribute by correcting a few questions or answer or by adding yours.
You can also open an issue in order to ask a question you may not have the answer to.

You can also make a pull request to improve the styling, but please make sure everything is still responsive.

### Project architecture
The project is exclusively front-end.

index.html displays the styling of the only page. Questions and answers are fetched from a table in js/fetchQuestion.js

### Q/A adding Guidelines
When you add new questions, remember a few things:
- Every question must be independent. Read each of your question independently before submitting them
- This site is mainly addressed to beginners in React. So please avoid too advanced questions
- FAQ.sh aims to be easy to read, from anywhere. Avoid technical details in order to keep it this way
- It is responsive, but the space is still limited. Please check that your questions and answers fit

### License
FAQ.sh is covered by the MIT Licence.
